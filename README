# aStar
Basic implementation of Djikstras and A* pathfinding algorithm made in c++ using SFML.

2 algorithms:
	- Dijkstra
	- A*
2 scenarios:
	- Shortest path for ambulance vehicles
	- Visualization of the algorithms
		- Left click to select starting point
		  Right click to select end point
			(there is no indication
			 starting point has been selected)
		- Checked vertices are teal colored
		- Shortest path or estimated shortest path(A*)
		  is colored in red
	- Rest of the controls are explained in game
Use arrow keys to navigate menu
Window is resizable
While in game:
	- Use scroll wheel to zoom in and out
	- Move mouse to edge to change view
